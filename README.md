# React Native Simple Components

This project is all about react native components, that are no longer supported or not built in to be used in the app. Components like checkbox, radio selector, group of radio selectors...etc.

Note this is only basic code no extra dependencies are needed

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js > 12](https://nodejs.org)
- [react native 0.70](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.70/environment-setup)
- [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/)
- [Cocoapods 1.10.1](https://cocoapods.org)
- [JDK > 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Android Studio and Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Installation

Open a Terminal in the project root and run:

```sh
npm install
```

Or if you want to create your own project just follow the steps in react native doc.

In this project I used expo
```sh
yarn create expo-app elements
```


We're done! Now you can build and run the app on your device/simulator.
